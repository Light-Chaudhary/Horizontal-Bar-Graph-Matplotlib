# Run Comparison Horizontal Bar Graph

## Description
This Python script creates a grouped horizontal bar chart comparing the cricket runs scored by three players — Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Shikhar Dhawan — over the years 2015 to 2020. The chart visually compares player performance side by side for each year, with years shown on the y-axis.

## Features
- Uses Matplotlib and NumPy for plotting
- Displays grouped horizontal bars for each player per year
- Uses different colors to distinguish players (optional)
- Adds labels, legend, grid, and a descriptive title
- Ensures years appear correctly on the y-axis with grouped bars that don’t overlap

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib library
- NumPy library

## Installation
Install required libraries if not already installed:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
